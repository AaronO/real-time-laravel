# Sign up for Pusher

Please sign up for a free Pusher account via [pusher.com/signup](https://pusher.com/signup).

Once you've done that you'll land within a "Main" application page. For this workshop all you need to do is take a note of the "App Credentials". These are:

* `app_id`
* `key`
* `secret`

## The Pusher Debug Console

Whilst you're in the Pusher Dashboard take a look around. In particular, take a look at the [Pusher Debug Console](https://pusher.com/docs/debugging#pusher_debug_console) as we'll refer to it through-out the workshop. It's really useful for developing and debugging your integration with Pusher.

## Where next?

* Now that you've got your "App Credentials" and familiarised yourself with the Pusher Debug Console it's time to [create your Laravel app](./laravel-app.md)
