Once you've done that you'll land within a "Main" application page. For this workshop all you need to do is take a note of the "App Credentials". These are:

* `app_id`
* `key`
* `secret`

## Where next?

* Now that you've got your "App Credentials" it's time to [create your Laravel app](./laravel-app.md)
