# Getting Started

In order to get started you'll need to [sign up for a free account with Pusher](./sign-up.md), take a note of the credentials for your Pusher app, [create a Laravel application](./laravel-app.md) and [integrate the Pusher library](./integrate-pusher.md) into that application.

For the latter you have a few options and the [Integrate Pusher](./integrate-pusher.md) section covers the options that you have.

## Where next?

* [Sign up for a free Pusher account](./sign-up.md)
* Already got a Pusher account? [Create a Laravel app](./laravel-app.md)
