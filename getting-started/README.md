# Getting Started <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap fa-2"></i>

In this section we're going to sign up for a **free Pusher account** and store Pusher application credentials in the PHP application. Then we're going to integrate the [Pusher PHP library](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-http-php/), followed by the [Pusher JavaScript library](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-js). 

As we go through we'll also take a look at how you can debug your integration which might come in handy if things go wrong - things never go wrong, right?!

## Where next?
