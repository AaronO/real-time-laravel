# What we've learned?

In this chapter we've:

* Seen a basic chat application in action using Pusher
* Added basic authentication to the application resulting in us being aware of how to integrate any authentication mechanism

## What next?

That's all the exercises complete. Congratulations!

Pusher offers more features than we could cram into a 2 hour workshop. So, let's finish off by having [a quick run-through of those additional features](../where-next/).
