# Activity Streams

Activity Streams are really just an extension of Notifications; they're provide a list of activities that have taken place, each of which could be a notification. So, in this section of the workshop we're going to expand on our knowledge of Pusher and use different events to identify types of activity. In addition, we're going to subscribe to a channel that requires authentication - a [Private Channel](https://pusher.com/docs/private_channels).

## Where next?

Let's get started by [Triggering Activity Events](./activities.md).
