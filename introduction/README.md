# About the Workshop

The Real-Time Laravel with Pusher Workshop aims to be simple to follow and can be undertaken either in a class room environment or on your own as a set of tutorials.

## Prerequisites

This workshop requires you to have:

* [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) installed
* a good understanding of PHP
* a basic understanding of [Laravel](http://laravel.com/)
* the [components required for a Laravel installation](http://laravel.com/docs/5.1#installation)
* a basic understanding of [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)<sup>†</sup>
* a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
* access to the Internet

*<sup>†</sup>jQuery - but it's 2015? jQuery is occasionally and unfairly ridiculed. We've chosen to use jQuery as it's a library that provides some browser fixes and productivity gains, as well as it being something that most developers will at least be familiar with. It's a good foundation to built upon. If there's enough demand for Angular, Ember, React, Vue.JS or frameworkX version in the future we'll certainly consider it.

## Instructor-Lead <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap fa-2"></i> v Self Taught

When undertaking the workshop with only the GitBook text the idea would be to read all of the content. When you're at an event with an instructor guiding you through the workshop then they'll talk through some of the content.

If a section is instructor-lead then it'll be flagged with a <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap fa-2"></i> and you don't need to read all the text in that section.

## GitBook Source

The workshop text has been built using [GitBook](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook). The source of this workshop can be found here:

If you find any errors or have any suggested improvements, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/pusher-community/real-time-laravel/issues). Or better yet, submit a pull request for a fix or change.

## Workshop Conventions

There are only a few conventions to look out for.

### Exercise <i class="fa fa-rocket fa-2"></i>

Anything marked with a <i class="fa fa-rocket fa-2"></i> indicates that this is an exercise that you should do.

### Instructor-lead sections <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap fa-2"></i>

As mentioned earlier, any section that will be instructor lead is flagged with a <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap fa-2"></i> so you don't need to read all the text in that section since the instructor will cover it.

### Notices

Informational notices will be highlighted in blue:

<div class="alert alert-info">I'm an informational notice</div>

Warnings will be highlighted in orange:

<div class="alert alert-warning">I'm a warning notice</div>

## A 2 Hour Workshop!?!

Yep, we only have two hours. Here's how we plan to achieve this:

1. Introduction - 10 minutes
2. Getting Started - 20 minutes
3. Notifications - 20 minutes
4. Activity Streams - 30 minutes
5. Chat - 30 minutes

That's 1 hour and 10 minutes, leaving a whole 10 minutes to spare.

*Fingers crossed!*

## Where next?

Since the two main technologies in this workshop are Laravel and Pusher, and it's assumed you've a good understanding of Laravel, it's time to [find out about Pusher](./what-is-pusher.md).
