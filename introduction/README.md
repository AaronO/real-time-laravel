# About the Workshop

The Real-Time Laravel with Pusher Workshop aims to be simple to follow and can be undertaken either in a class room environment or on your own as a set of tutorials.

## Online Reference

The workshop can be found online here:

## Instructor-Lead <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap fa-2"></i> v Self Taught

When undertaking the workshop with only the GitBook text the idea would be to read all of the content. When you're at an event with an instructor guiding you through the workshop then they'll talk through some of the content.

If a section is instructor-lead then it'll be flagged with a <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap fa-2"></i> and you don't need to read all the text in that section.

## GitBook Source

The workshop text has been built using [GitBook](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook). The source of this workshop can be found here:
